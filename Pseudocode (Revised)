**Measurement Converter (Physics Oriented)**

create JFrame 
add tabbed panels and drag 6 panels 
label each panels of different catgories (welcome, SI unit table, mass, distance, temp, time) 

 // Suggested Variables declaration                  
    private  ComboBox1;
    private  ConvertButton;
    private  TabbedPaneV;
    private  TextFieldResult;
    private  TextFieldValue;
    private  jLabel1;
    private jLabel2;
    private  jLabel3;
    private jLabel4;
    private  jPanel1;
    private  jPanel2;
    private jPanel3;
    private  jScrollPane1;
    private  jTable1;

SI UNIT TABLE panel: 
- add tabel 
- label values and names of columns and rows 
- add label "SI UNITS" 

** Units:
Temp- c° and f°
Time- s, m, h
Dist- cm, m, km
Mass- mg, g, kg
               **

-user clicks drop down menu and chooses method of conversion
-user enters number value to first text field
 -if letter or character value entered, program will not run
 -repeat until valid number value is entered
-program runs calculation based on chosen conversion method (combo box choice)
-program returns converted value in second text field
-rinse and repeat



FINAL:
//see below for classes and their encompassed variables

When (any) tab is clicked:
 -open unit frame
   -colour is set
   -combo box is set to default measure (usually smallest unit to middle unit conversion)
   -text fields are cleared
 -user chooses conversion method from drop down box
 -user enters number value into first text field (does not compute if letter or special character is entered, second field does not
  accept text)
 -program runs entered value in corresponding calculator
 -result is printed in second text field
