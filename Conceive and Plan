Idea: Measurment Converter 
Client(s): two physics students 



Vist#1: 
Establish an idea- unit converter for reference in physics
Get to know clients  
 Clients Likes: Simplicity, easy to use, colourful
 Clients Dislike: Lots of text, hard to read/distinguish


Vist#2: 
Figure out what program would look like (make sketches, tables, drawings to get a good idea of what client wants)
Discuss what units would be most useful for them (need 6)- distance, temperature, time, mass, volume, area

Goals: To make a working program with GUI that adheres to our clients needs and helps them pass their courses. We hope to learn from
past projects and ensure that this program is the best it can be when it is submitted.
