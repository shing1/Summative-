Idea: Measurment Converter 
Client(s): two physics students

Vist#1: 
Establish an idea, learn criteria (six measurements: distance, time, temperature, mass, volume, area)
Get to know clients (What they want+need in the program)
 Clients Like: Simplicity, easy to use, colourful
 Clients Dislike: Text driven, hard to distinguish, not clear


Vist#2: 
Present idea to clients and dicuss what works and what doesn't 
Discuss parameters and timeline, get any other details from clients about what they want in the final product

Goal- to create a working program that successfully converts the methods asked of it. The final product will hopefully help the physics
students with their studies
