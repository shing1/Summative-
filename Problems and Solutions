This is where we will post the problems that we encountered and solutiions of how we overcome it 


1) inital plan was to create muliple JFrames; each Jframe would have assigned different unit conversion.
Ex: mass Jframe, distance jFrame, etc. From my experience, it gets very hard to those
Jframes. For example, i was able to go to next jframes using a button. when running, it always open to a specfic Jframe first; not the 
Jframe desired to be open first. We tried to check the packages and locations of the file although no luck. From extenral researching, we 
found creating a project with mulplie jframe is a bad practice.

we instead use tabbed panels as an alternative way to combat this problem and found this featrue to be easier to use. furthermore, 
we need to revision our prototype. 

At first, keeping track of all the designs was difficult, and we found it confusing between when you could and when you couldn't reuse designs.
When each unit of measurement became a file of its own, it was much easier to distinguish between them, and to compare models to ensure visual
similarity.

The initial prototype was not clear enough and needed to be changed to be able to show the clients with the highest degree of accuracy
what the finished product would look like. The program itslf also needed to be easy to use, which we found with all the buttons to be navigated 
was not ass effective as the tabbed windows. When the prototype was remodelled, the clients seemed much happier with the results and more
enthusiastic to see the end result.
